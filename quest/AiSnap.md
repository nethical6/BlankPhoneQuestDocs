# AI Snap

The AI Snap quest harnesses the power of AI to check if youâ€™ve completed a task. Simply use your camera to snap a picture of the completed task or the area after youâ€™re done, and the AI will verify if itâ€™s finished. Itâ€™s perfect for household chores, organization, or any task requiring visual proof. Every time you complete one, you earn **5 coins** to use in the app!

**Example use cases:** Clean your bedroom, Organize your desk, Do laundry, Touch Grass.

## Fields
- **Quest Title:** A unique name for your task
- **Instruction:** A description for your task. Markdown is supported.
- **Days:** The days when this quest can be performed
- **Auto Destroy:** Date when the quest is destroyed
- **Task Description:** A detailed explanation of the task (e.g., "Clean the bedroom").
- **Reference Image:** An image of the area where the quest should be performed. If the quest isnâ€™t performed in that area, itâ€™s marked as incomplete.

## How It Works
The AI Snap quest starts with you setting up the task details. Use your camera to take a photo when youâ€™ve completed the task. The AI compares the photo to the Reference Image and Task Description to verify completion. If the location or task doesnâ€™t match, the quest is marked incomplete. You mark it done manually once the AI confirms, and you earn 5 coins.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Bedroom Cleaning
**Goal:** Clean your bedroom every Saturday.

- **Quest Title:** "Clean Bedroom"
- **Instruction:** "Take a photo of your cleaned bedroom to show itâ€™s done."
- **Days:** Saturday
- **Auto Destroy:** 17-12-12
- **Task Description:** "Clean the bedroom, including making the bed, vacuuming the floor, and organizing the desk."
- **Reference Image:** A photo of your bedroom before cleaning, showing the specific area.

**How It Works:** On Saturday, you clean your bedroom, then take a photo of the cleaned space. The AI compares it to the Reference Image to ensure itâ€™s the same room and checks if it looks clean based on the Task Description. If verified, you mark it done and earn 5 coins. If the photo shows a different location or an unclean room, itâ€™s incomplete. The quest auto-destroys by 17-12-12.

**Benefit:** Ensures a tidy space and rewards your effort.

### Use Case 2: Desk Organization
**Goal:** Organize your desk every weekday afternoon.

- **Quest Title:** "Organize Desk"
- **Instruction:** "Take a photo of your organized desk to prove itâ€™s tidy."
- **Days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- **Auto Destroy:** 17-12-12
- **Task Description:** "Organize your desk, including clearing papers, arranging pens, and wiping the surface."
- **Reference Image:** A photo of your desk before organizing, showing the specific area.

**How It Works:** Each weekday afternoon, you organize your desk, then snap a photo. The AI verifies that youâ€™re in the correct location (matching the Reference Image) and that the desk is tidy (based on the Task Description). If confirmed, you mark it done and earn 5 coins. If the location or task doesnâ€™t match, itâ€™s incomplete. The quest auto-destroys after 17-12-12.

**Benefit:** Promotes a clutter-free workspace with visual verification and rewards.

### Use Case 3: Laundry Folding
**Goal:** Fold laundry every Sunday in your laundry room.

- **Quest Title:** "Fold Laundry"

- **Days:** Sunday
- **Auto Destroy:** 17-12-12
- **Task Description:** "Fold all clean laundry in the laundry room until neatly stacked."
- **Reference Image:** A photo of your laundry room or laundry basket before folding.

**How It Works:** On Sunday, you fold your laundry in the laundry room, then take a photo of the neatly stacked clothes. The AI checks that the photo matches the Reference Image (laundry room) and Task Description (folded laundry). If verified, you mark it done and earn 5 coins. If the photo shows a different area or unfolded laundry, itâ€™s incomplete. The quest auto-destroys by 17-12-12.

**Benefit:** Ensures household tasks are completed with AI verification and rewards.

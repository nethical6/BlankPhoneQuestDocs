# Deep Focus

The Deep Focus quest helps you stay productive by blocking all apps except the selected ones for a set amount of time, allowing you to concentrate on what matters most. Itâ€™s perfect for deep work, studying, or tackling important tasks. Plus, every time you complete one, you earn **5 coins** to use in the app!

**Example use cases:** Study for an exam, Write a report, Code a project.

## Summary

| Title         | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Reward        | 5 coins |
| Inital Focus Time | Duration of first session |
| Increment Daily By | Duration with which to increment daily |
| Goal Focus Time | maximum focus duration |


## Fields
- **Quest Title:** A unique name for your focus session
- **Instruction:** A description for your task. Markdown is supported.
- **Days:** The days when this quest can be performed
- **Auto Destroy:** Date when the quest is destroyed
- **Initial Focus Time:** The duration of the first focus session (e.g., 25 minutes)
- **Increment Daily By:** How much time is added to the focus session with each successful completion (e.g., 5 minutes). Set to 0 if no increment is desired.
- **Goal Focus Time:** The maximum focus time after which it no longer increases (e.g., 120 minutes)

## How It Works
The Deep Focus quest starts with an Initial Focus Time for your first session. Each successful completion increases the focus duration by the Increment Daily By amount, up to the Goal Focus Time. If you donâ€™t want the focus time to increase, set Increment Daily By to 0 and make Initial Focus Time and Goal Focus Time the same.
